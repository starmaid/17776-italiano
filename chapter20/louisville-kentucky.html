      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> What was your name?</p>
      <p class="TIM even closer"><span class="char">TIM even closer: </span> Tim.</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> And this is Tim. And you, the reader, are reading this on uh,</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> What's that site with the name that sounds like ESPN? Sports site.</p>

      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> ESB Nation. And you've been reading in on our little conversation here. It's in somewhat poor taste to address you directly, but some things are more important than the fourth wall. One of those things is your personal safety and well-being.</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> We're about to talk about Eleven Jones Cave. This is a cave I live in, but I can only do that because I am unkillable. If you're reading this prior to the year 2026, you are extraordinarily killable.</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> Do not attempt to enter this cave. I say this for two reasons, the first of which is that there is a very real risk of you getting stuck in it. The second, and more important, reason is that this cave harbors extraordinarily high levels of carbon dioxide.</p>

      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> I know how people are. Maybe you're telling yourself, "well, I'm special, I won't let myself get poisoned by carbon dioxide." You will, and you'll be remembered as the person who died in some crappy cave because you read it in a story you read online about sentient 178th-century space probes who watch football all day, even though the most handsome character in the story completely interrupted everything to <em>explicitly tell you not to.</em></p>

      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> Fair enough.</p>
      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> You're still on Question Three. Why's it called Eleven Jones Cave?</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> Nobody really agrees on the story there. The most boring answer is that it was near a couple of properties owned by guys named Leven and Jones, and the name just kind of morphed out of that.</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> The more fun story is that in the 1800s, there was a gang of bandits known as the Eleven Jones Gang. They lived in the cave and built bedrooms out of its little corridors. They installed an iron gate in here to protect all the stolen treasure they stashed here. If you believe all the stories everyone ever told about this cave, there's tons and tons of treasure back here. There's a Confederate sword from the Civil War. There's a cannon, for some reason.</p>

      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> Well, I don't agree with that! That's why I'm on this hike. To find out as much as I can about the land and the people who live here.</p>

      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> It's going to matter to your future self. What if it's 50,000 years down the road and you're all out of mysteries? Mystery is an exhaustible resource. If you depend on that to make you happy, you better start saving it instead of gorging yourself like a little piglet.</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> Know where that'll leave you? You'll have nothing left to explore in the world, so you'll look up at the stars, waiting for galaxies to collide. You might see it happen every couple million years. The whole time you're waiting, you'll wish for some old forest to discover, some open house to visit. There won't be any. I bet then you'll remember what I told you.</p>
      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> Well, what do you do?</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> That's Question Five. I play the hits. You know what this is?</p>
      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> A video game, I guess.</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> It's Double Dribble. One of those old handheld Konami games. The screen is, I mean, you can barely even call it a sceen. It's just a printed picture of a basketball court and a few little LCD illustrations that flip on and off in front of it. Way back when it was made, my grandson showed it to me. I'd never played a video game in my life, I figured I was too old for any of that business. But I played it and played it. You're this little guy, and you have to dribble around the defenders and score. That's the whole game. You get to 99 points, you win.</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> Takes some time to really get the hang of, but not that much time. Tell you the truth, you play it for a couple weeks and you've got it down, you never miss a shot. So I made up this game where I'd try to beat it as quick as I could, and I'd try to beat my own record. I've got this little timer with me. I'd hit the button with my foot to start it, and as soon as I got to 99, I'd stop it.</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> And eventually, I realized that it was impossible to beat the game any faster than three minutes, 18 seconds. For about a year, I tried to beat it faster than 3:18 and I just couldn't do it. So I'd see if I could beat it in an exact time. Like exactly five minutes, or exactly 20 minutes and seven seconds. And without a timer, it's kind of hard to</p>
      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> You played this for a year?</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> That's Question Six. I've been playing it for 285 years. Usually about eight hours a day, sometimes a lot more.</p>

      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> I decided I'd play it for a total 300 years, that's it. Any more than that and I may as well just stare at the walls of this cave. I kind of feel that way already some of the time. But I've got to make it last, though. There are other games. There's Shinobi, Jordan vs. Bird, lots of others. There are like ten thousand of them. But suppose I get 300 years of play out of each of them. That's only three million years.</p>

      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> I'm a safety in a long-distance football game between</p>
      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> I thought you were a running back.</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> No. Common misconception. The other team's been trying to tackle me so long, a lot of people forgot what position I played.</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> Anyway, it's a long-distance game between Louisville and Charlotte. So the field's about 330 miles long. Not as long as some of those other games, but the Appalachians are right around midfield. And it's just a bear goin' up and down those mountains. Charlotte was whippin' our asses, it was 84-14.</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> Thing about long-distance games, though, is they come with a ton of paperwork. Rules on top of rules on top of rules. A lot of them are just copied and pasted from other games wholesale, who the hell knows what's in 'em? We were around 20 years into this football game before we really went through the rule books and started looking for something we could use.</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> It's about as big as an encyclopedia set, but me and the rest of the folks on defense spent months going through 'em. Finally we found one. It must have been a leftover from some old game they forgot to take out. It said, basically, if you get possession of the ball and stay in your own end zone for 10,000 years without being tackled, it's an automatic win for you, game over. And of course, our end zone was defined as the city limits of Louisville.</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> So one of our cornerbacks, she was like, "if there's somewhere you can hide in Louisville, maybe it's worth trying." And I was like, "well, think of how many searchers Charlotte's gonna be able to recruit over the course of 10,000 years. They'll flip this city upside-down, there'll be thousands of them." And but she was like, "well, it's either that or we're losing this game."</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> A few weeks later, they're just about to score on us again. They've got the ball at Mt. Washington, so you know, they're knocking on the door. They have this quarterback who can just zip it. Good conditions, he can throw it 700 yards. It's one of the most beautiful thrown footballs I've ever seen with my own two eyes. So he just launches it, but the wideout I'm covering falls in a construction site. All of a sudden, I'm all alone. Easy pick for me, but instead of trying to run it back, I retreat to Louisville, right?</p>
      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> Wow, so ...</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> Yep, and you can probably fill in the rest. When I was a boy, you know, eight, nine, ten, I used to go back here and play. I was like, "I bet I'm the only person in the world who even remembers that little cave at all." And look at me! I was right.</p>

      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> You know you're famous, right? Like, really really famous? Nobody's just disappeared in the middle of a game and stayed missing for as long as you have. You're like a legend.</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> A lot of good it does me. I wake up every morning on a rock. It's wet, smells like crap. The nanos clean the carbon dioxide out of the air and bring me food, but the only food they know how to synthesize is granola bars. God bless those little fellas, but they're dumber than hell.</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> So if this is what fame is, you can have it. By the way, that was Question Eight, and the answer is, no, I didn't know I was famous and I barely care. You have two questions left.</p>
      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> Okay.</p>
      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> .</p>
      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> .</p>
      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> Uhhhhhhhhh.</p>
      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> .</p>
      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> .</p>
      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> .</p>
      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> Does this game really mean so much to you that you're willing to hide in a cave for 10,000 years?</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> Well,</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> .</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> .</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> .</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> The game only barely matters to me at this point.</p>
      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> There seems to be a theme here.</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> It's enough to keep me going. It's an objective, you know? It's an objective.</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> You know, I was an old man. I was 87 years old the day we stopped aging. And I was in good health and all that, but I was still waking up every day and telling myself, "Eddie, could be any day now. It could be any day." And I made peace with that. Having an end, knowing one day would be the last day, it felt ... correct. It felt comfortable.</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> That's been taken from me. The telomeres in my cells stopped shrinking. My wrinkles faded themselves away. I remember on my 128th birthday, I woke up and it was beautiful and I went out for a run. I hadn't gone out for a run my whole life! It was the best time I ever had. Goddamn ... it was the best morning I ever had. I didn't even have good shoes for it, just my old loafers. Got blisters like you wouldn't believe.</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> Those were the times, but those times gave way to being afraid. Who wants to live forever? What am I gonna do with forever? And so I figured, you know, I need to get good at living life from second to second. Forget all these big conquests. Live second, to second, to second, to second, one at a time.</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> That's what this cave is for.</p>
      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> You're kind of like a monk or something then, I guess.</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> Suppose I kind of am.</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> But this cave's even more to me than that. You know, there used to be newspaper articles and things about this cave. Every couple decades, someone would rediscover it and write about it. And people would be like, "well, how about it? Eleven Jones Cave! A mystery cave right in the middle of this big city, and we didn't even know it!" And then they'd move on to something else, and then 20 or 30 years later, someone would remember it again.</p>

      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> And now nobody does. Even my childhood friends, the ones I used to play with when I was a boy, they've forgotten about the cave we discovered in the way back when. Or else they don't care, because I'm sure as hell none of them come to visit.</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> So this is my cave. And I don't mean it like I own it. I mean it like, this cave is known only to me. It's my duty to know every little crack, every little place the rock juts out. It's my duty to know when the soil gets saturated and the water's about to come wandering through here. It's my duty to look after the little cave beetles. They don't have eyes, you know, they need a little help sometimes.</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> It's my little speck of the only world I know, and I love it to bits.</p>

      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> Yeah. Would you um</p>
      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> Would you like to know God personally?</p>

      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> ... ah.</p>
      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> Because um, see like, the bridge to God is through the cross. I have a diagram, um, it kind of shows how like</p>
      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> How you cross the bridge of death to find salvation in</p>
      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> Here, you can have this one.</p>
      <p class="ED"><span class="char">ED: </span> Ohhhkay. Okay. Just ... here, yes, I'll take it, thank you. Thanks. Great.</p>

      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> I'm just</p>
      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> I know the Lord's up there. I want to let everyone know He's coming. But I'm just so nervous to tell people. I've been trying all these years and I always feel stupid. So I get real nervous every time.</p>
      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> And the printer prints it weird, and it's all blocky and fuzzy when you print it out, so it looks stupid.</p>

      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> I've thought about that. All of us have. There's a lot less people who go to church than there used to be, because that's what a lot of people think.</p>
      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> .</p>
      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> But I don't think so. But I think about it. And I think, well, I can't be.

      <p class="TIM"><span class="char">TIM: </span> And then I think, "maybe I am in Heaven, and Heaven is scary."</p>
