  <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> Beh, era "Durazo." E poi non so quando, avrò rinnovato la patente o qualcosa del genere e hanno sbagliato. Quindi ora sono Jason Durabo per sempre.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> Oh wow. Di questi tempi, non pensavo che ancora succedevano errori simili!</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> Ah, l'avrei potuto correggere, sicuramente. Se mi ricordassi quand'è stato. Cioè, mio papà si chiama Durazo, quindi ero di sicuro Durazo alla nascita. Ma sulla mia prima tessera di football, dice "Durabo." Era del 5583. Quindi, pare che è successo là in mezzo.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> OK, ma ora devi spiegare perché <em>tu</em> ti chiami Durabo!</p>
      <p class="EMILY"><span class="char">EMILY: </span> Ma sai, Lori? Sai? È una bella domanda.</p>
      <p class="LAUGHTER"><span class="char">RISATE: </span> <em>risate</em></p>
      <p class="EMILY"><span class="char">EMILY: </span> Gli ho detto, "Senti, J. Ho già cambiato nome per te una volta, non mi va di rifarlo."</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> Vero?</p>
      <p class="EMILY"><span class="char">EMILY: </span> Ma dopo un po' è diventato un fastidio. Durabo e Durazo, Durabo e Durazo, quando ci invitavano ai matrimoni, quando parlavano di noi al telegiornale. Quindi ho gettato la spugna.</p>

There's just too much to remember.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> Oh, absolutely! I mean, it's thousands of years! You can only remember so much. OK, embarrassing story time.</p>
      <p class="EMILY"><span class="char">EMILY: </span> Story time! OK, OK, hold on. Story time is very important around here. Let me put on some coffee.</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> Em, I got it! Don't get up.</p>
      <p class="EMILY"><span class="char">EMILY: </span> Thank you, baby.</p>
      <p class="EMILY"><span class="char">EMILY: </span> OK. So.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> So ... this would have been in the 13,500s. Because, yes, I was apartment-shopping in Seattle. So sometime around then. I was single at the time, so I was just looking for a one-bedroom. But like a real one-bedroom, you know how landlords are always listing studio apartments as one-bedrooms.</p>
      <p class="EMILY"><span class="char">EMILY: </span> Ohh yes.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> That's a whole other situation. Anyway, I see the place and I'm like, this is perfect. Beautiful bay windows, washer and dryer in the building, tall ceilings, exposed brick, everything. It's everything I want, it's just perfect. So I sign the lease right there on the spot, because it's like it's just perfect for me. It's literally everything I'm looking for in an apartment.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> <em>Well</em>. This is, like, a month after I moved in. I was doing the dishes, and then I just froze. And I realized</p>
      <p class="LAUGHTER"><span class="char">LAUGHTER: </span> <em>laughter</em></p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> I realized I had lived there before!</p>
      <p class="LAUGHTER"><span class="char">LAUGHTER: </span> <em>laughter</em></p>
      <p class="EMILY"><span class="char">EMILY: </span> Oh no! Oh my God! When?</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> I don't know, way way back-- a really long time ago. You know, actually, I went back and looked it up. I'd lived there for two years back in 7174. And I realized I'd arranged the furniture pretty much the same way and everything. Oh God, it was so weird.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> And you know what was even weirder, was when I went back and looked up my old photos from when I lived there before. It was unreal, seeing myself in the same living room from 6,000 years ago. It was like looking like a ghost. I couldn't decide whether it was more scary or funny, because obviously, you looked at my wardrobe and it was clear, I had some serious 7100s going on.</p>
      <p class="EMILY"><span class="char">EMILY: </span> Tell me you were wearing a snap bracelet.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> Oh yeah. Ohhhh yeah. I had like five on one arm, skinny jeans, bowling shoes. It was like taking a time machine back to the 7170s.</p>
      <p class="EMILY"><span class="char">EMILY: </span> Oh that's so great.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> Fuck it was so bad. Ooh, what is this here?</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> French press. It's the only way to brew coffee. Quicker, too.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> Too fancy for me, Jesus. Too fancy. Thank you.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> So Jason, Emily's told me a little about your project! How's it going?</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> Oh, well. It's a lot of work, but it's a lot of fun.</p>

      <p class="EMILY"><span class="char">EMILY: </span> Jason.</p>
      <p class="EMILY"><span class="char">EMILY: </span> C'mon, you're being ridiculous. You can tell Lori.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> No, it's OK! Seriously, don't mind me if I'm being nosy.</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> No, no, you know what, sorry. I'm just used to not talking about it. It's kind of a weird story anyway, I don't know if you wanna</p>
      <p class="EMILY"><span class="char">EMILY: </span> J, oh my God! It's a great story, tell it.</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> Ohhhhkay.</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> So.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> You're right, this story sucks, I'm bored.</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> OK, OK, OK! Alright, so. Do you know who Koy Detmer is?</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> I don't.</p>

He held a clipboard most of his career, though.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> So he was like a backup player, you mean?</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> Oh, yeah, exactly. He was a backup quarterback.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> Guh, talking to you is just like talking to her. Y'all football players, I swear.</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> Sorry, sorry, sorry. So, the thing about being a backup quarterback in the NFL was that you rarely played. You weren't all that famous as far as quarterbacks go. Kids didn't ask you for all that many autographs. So an autographed Koy Detmer football is pretty rare, right? Well, I'm trying to grab every single one.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> That's ... interesting. So you're a collector?</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> I'm actually a player. It's the game, basically.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> Literally, you mean? A football game?</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> Yep. I'm actually technically playing it right now.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> Oh God! <em>[laughing]</em> Oh my God, do I need to ... am I gonna get tackled by somebody? Do I need to run for cover?</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> <em>[laughing]</em> You're fine, you're fine.</p>
      <p class="EMILY"><span class="char">EMILY: </span> Lori, you know what, if it's any consolation to you, I was a tight end for 4,000 years. If things go south, I'll throw a block for you, OK?</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> Uh huh.</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> It's basically a dead game right now, anyway. Basically, me and 19 other players are in an everyone-for-themselves type of game. We go all over the country, trying to find every ball Koy Detmer ever autographed.</p>
    <div class="image-container">

What you're describing is almost kind of a giant treasure hunt! It's basically geocaching, right?</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> For a while, yeah, that's the best way of describing it. The first step was searching eBay, calling up memorabilia collectors, trying to track down all the Detmer balls we could.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> How many were there?</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> At first, it seemed like there were only 19 of them in the entire country. Just our luck, right? 20 players, 19 footballs. It was kind of a mad dash. And see, we weren't allowed to just buy them off these dealers, it was against the rules.</p>
      <p class="EMILY"><span class="char">EMILY: </span> Uh, yeah. Let me just butt in here, Lori? That was against <em>my</em> rules. I was like, J, you are not taking money out of our account so you can buy the damn football. When I played, you know how I got the ball? I forced fumbles and I caught the ball, and your punk ass is doing the same.</p>
      <p class="LAUGHTER"><span class="char">LAUGHTER: </span> <em>laughter</em></p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> And you know what? I did pretty well without. I ended up just begging this one guy for his Detmer autographed ball, and he was like, "sure, this thing wouldn't get me more than 25 bucks anyway." I stole a second one out of a basement in Colorado, where he played college ball. Kind of got lucky with that one. So I took those two, drove up to Montana, went deep into the woods, and buried them for safekeeping.</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> After those first 19 were claimed, there were years and years of gridlock. One guy was dumb enough to keep his football on him. He had too many at a bar in Illinois, ran his mouth a little too much, got his ass beat, lost the ball. There were a couple stories like that. But by and large, that stage of the game was mostly about digging up forgotten Detmer balls. The ones that were sitting in attics and old boxes for 15,000 years and forgotten about.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> That must have been a nightmare.</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> At first it was really fun. It was a lot of really challenging detective work. At first I had all my research stored on my computer, but I got hacked by another team and lost a ton of it. So I did it the old-fashioned way. After a while I'd probably filled two dozen notepads full of notes. Phone numbers, coordinates, notes on where I thought the balls might be, intel on how tough they'd be to break into, all that.</p>
    <div class="image-container">
    <img class="lazy" data-original="https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rdsL5UWtsu4nHkz0H5j2A8hzoq0=/1120x630/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8460397/nashville700.gif"></div>  <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> But yeah, after a point it was damn near impossible. I mean, I knew from day one I was gonna run into dead ends, but it was so hard to know where to start. It was like being an archaeologist, except there was no rhyme or reason or pattern for what I was trying to find. I couldn't narrow down my search in any way, so I was just going around cities, taping flyers to lampposts and stuff, like "have you seen this Koy Detmer ball?" And after a while, I realized, hell, I'm a smart guy, but I'm not like this genius detective or anything. So that was the next stage of the game. I started trying to thieve balls from the other players.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> Did you ever steal any?</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> Yep. Ginny and Manuel had teamed up and had a little stash of four Detmers. I staked them out for a while and found their place in Vermont. One day, both of them hit the road, so I busted in and took them. You know where I found them? You want to guess?</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> Um.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> .</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> .</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> Above the kitchen cabinet. Like, sitting on top of the cabinet. Nobody looks up there.</p>
      <p class="EMILY"><span class="char">EMILY: </span> Oh, whoa. God, we've lived here for 300 years and I've never looked up there.</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> Shit, that's really good! Well, there's an idea for next time. You just come up with that?</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> I used to work for the DEA, back when ... you know, back when.</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> Well if they'd hid 'em there, I might've never found it. They hid in what I call a "bullshit cabinet." My theory is, every home, no matter how big or small, has one drawer nobody uses. It's usually the bottom drawer of a two-drawer nightstand. Thing about furniture is, it's gotta be waist-high or so, right? Furniture makers don't want that space to go to waste, so they're like, "oh, here's a little cabinet or drawer or whatever you're never gonna use." They had a cabinet in their grill out back, which is kind of the ultimate bullshit cabinet. Sure enough, ball was in there.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> Did you feel bad about it? Just stealing their property like that?</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> It's a forced fumble. I basically went up on them and stripped the ball. Same thing. That's honestly the way I feel about it.</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> .</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> .</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> So you're still playing?</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> Technically. Or at least, it was technically. About 70 years ago, me and Mike, this guy Mike, the two of us decided to chop up the win. We were the only two left with any footballs. 26 were mine, 17 were his. I figured, once this game was down to just two people, it would take forever. So I figured, hell, I'll take half the win and move on. And then he fucked me over.</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> He just ... we said we were gonna meet up in Charleston.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> But Charleston is</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> Charleston, West Virginia.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> Oh! Oh yeah, right. Supposed to have good biscuits, right?</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> Eh, they're biscuits. Anyway, Mike and I decided we would meet game officials in Charleston to end the game.</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> The roads around there are really winding and hilly, right? Parts of it, you're basically driving on the side of a mountain. So I've got my footballs in the trunk, I'm driving, driving, I round a corner, <em>BAM</em>. Mike's in his truck, he just T-bones me going like 50. I fly down the mountain, engine's on fire. The nanos carry me out of my car and basically strap me down in the mud so I can't move. I'm like, "the car! Save the fucking car!" But of course, they don't give a shit. And the car just bursts into flames. Everything's burned up. Nothing's left.</p>

Oh my God, that's fucking ... that's horrible!</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> The refs showed up just in time to be like, "yep, these are not footballs anymore." So now there were only 17 Detmer balls known to humankind, and Mike had all of them.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> But you said you're still playing.</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> Well, there's been a break in the case.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> Oh, good. We're in a cop show now.</p>
      <p class="EMILY"><span class="char">EMILY: </span> I swear, he acts like it sometimes.</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> Well see, the game's not officially over yet. If one player seems to have all the Detmer balls in the country, the officials tell you, "OK, we're blowing the game dead, so nobody can try to take possession of your footballs. But the other players do have 500 years to try and find any other Detmer balls that we don't know about. If they do, the game starts back up again. If they don't within those 500 years, you're the official winner.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> You found one.</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> I think I might have found one. I gave my businesss card to an antiques dealer years and years ago, probably 50 years ago. A few days ago he rings me up and says, "hey, I had a guy come in here talking about a Detmer ball his grandpa used to have." I guess he swore all up and down that he had one sitting around in a storage bin. So I'm gonna check it out.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> Where is it? Can I ask?</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> We think it's in, uh ... New York.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> Like ... New York City?</p>
      <p class="EMILY"><span class="char">EMILY: </span> Mhmm.</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> I'm headed there in the morning.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> You're actually going out there?</p>
      <p class="JASON"><span class="char">JASON: </span> Ordered the gear for it and everything.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> Well ... hell, good luck!</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span></p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span></p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> You know, I never went to New York. Never even visited. I don't know why I didn't. I remember watching Sesame Street when I was little, and I liked how people would just sit on their steps and talk to each other in front of these nice and neat and square buildings. And all they had to do was cross the street or go next door to talk to each other.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> Then I went to school, got a job, you know, you get busy. And it's ...</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> Who was it who said, uh, "even if life is forever, each moment of it is a miracle?" I think that's just something we tell ourselves. We're just ordinary and forever, I think. There's a leveling out that happens if you live forever and ever without anything to lose.</p>
      <p class="LORI"><span class="char">LORI: </span> New York was probably just one more place with a lot of buildings. But I missed seeing it, that's a thing I lost. That's one of the only things I've ever lost. Thinking about that kind of gets me right in the heart. Like a little xylophone hammer is, you know, just hits it. ... It's a note we never play anymore.</p>
