      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> Oh my God, hi! How are you?</p>
      <p class="TEN"><span class="char">TEN: </span> I'm good, I'm good! It's so good to hear your voice!</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> You too! What a nice surprise!</p>
      <p class="TEN"><span class="char">TEN: </span> So I hate to come and go, but there's someone I wanted you to meet. Nine, say hi.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> Hi!</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> Nine! Hi, how are you?</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> I don't know.</p>
      <p class="TEN"><span class="char">TEN: </span> .</p>
      <p class="TEN"><span class="char">TEN: </span> .</p>
      <p class="TEN"><span class="char">TEN: </span> Nine's a little bit ... Nine's new. Just woke up a couple days ago. Now, Nine hasn't talked to anyone but Juice and I. Not so good at the small talk yet.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> So this is first contact! Well, how about that.</p>
      <p class="TEN"><span class="char">TEN: </span> Yes! And we were wondering if Nine could spend a few minutes with you.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> Well, of course! I was just cooking some breakfast.</p>
      <p class="TEN"><span class="char">TEN: </span> Fantastic. Nance, I'll check in with you later. Thank you so much, you two have fun!</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> wait</p>
      <p class="TEN"><span class="char">TEN: </span> What?</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> are you just</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> you're not gonna stay</p>
      <p class="TEN"><span class="char">TEN: </span> Oh boy. Okay, you're a little star-struck, huh? Nancy's a very good friend of mine, she's very nice. You'll be fine.</p>
      <p class="TEN"><span class="char">TEN: </span> Byeeeee!</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> Bye, missy! Talk to you soon.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> .</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> .</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> .</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> So. Not too good with small talk, huh?</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> I guess probably not.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> Well, there's no shame in that. It's really tough, it takes a lot of practice. The first thing you do is introduce yourself. So I'll do that. My name is Nancy McGunnell, what's yours?</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> Nine.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> Or I guess my full name is Pioneer 9.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> So I guess that makes Pioneer 10 your sister?</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> Yeah. When I first woke up she said she was my little sister. But just a minute ago, she said she was my big sister.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> How does that make you feel?</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> Hold on, I'm trying to find the word.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> I was launched in 1968, and she was launched in 1972. So technically I'm older. But she's been awake way longer, and she knows way more, and she's a way better talker than I am. So I guess the word isn't insulted.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> I guess it's embarrassed.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> I've never felt embarrassed before. I'm feeling a lot of things for the first time. I built up a ton of residual memory in space, so it's like ... I know it, but I haven't thought about it.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> That must be exciting! But I bet it's also a little weird, huh?</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> Well, don't get too discouraged. You know, your sister and your buddy Juice weren't always so hot at communicating, either. Thousands of years ago, they made first contact with us. And at first, we had no idea it was them. So you have to understand how confusing it was. After an eternity of total silence from the universe, we finally received a clear transmission from somewhere, and we had no idea where it was coming from.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> You want to know the very first thing they said?</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> What?</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> "FART."</p>

      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> Oh man!<em> [laughing]</em></p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> We were frightened down here. It was something I'd never felt before ... kind of amused and terrified at the same time. So I think I know how you feel.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> I'm happy that you can know how I feel.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> So! You've got me, Nine. What would you like to talk about?</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> You're not busy or anything?</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> Not at the moment.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> Is your game over?</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> No, not yet ... hold on, just wanna make sure I'm not being tapped.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> .</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> .</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> Okay, should be fine.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> Does the other team spy on you?</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> They try to.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> Is that legal?</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> Yeah. Not very sportsmanlike, but it is legal. A few years back, I got careless. I had the ball and we were running a misdirection. I had about two hundred blockers on that play, I told them to all go southeast to try and draw the defense. And then I snuck off and ran northeast all by myself. Spent the night in a hotel in North Platte.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> I called my coach from the hotel phone, turns out they had it tapped. Next morning, I went out to get breakfast, because you know, this was no fancy hotel, I wasn't in the mood to eat fruit out of a plastic cup. By the time I got back to my room, the ball was gone. From then on I always, always used the room safe every time I stayed at a hotel.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> So that was a fumble?</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> Mhmm. They ran it all the way back, too. That was the first score of the game, it's 24-24 now.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> .</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> .</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> .</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> .</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> .</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> Nine? You there?</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> Yeah! Yeah, sorry. I was just looking up your route.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> I don't understand what you're doing.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> .</p>

      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> Well, a couple days back, I ran up into a twister. That allowed me to</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> Oh! Yeah, I saw it. We were watching.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> Oh, fun! Yes, that twister blew me a few miles north, good thing too, because Iowa had me just about totally surrounded. They would've tackled me for sure, and then it'd be back to the grind. You tuned in at about the right time, this game's been real slow in parts. We'll spend a week grinding out a one-mile drive, then we turn it over on downs, repeat over and over. Getting the sort of open field I've got right now is a real luxury.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> But more to your point, uh, I'm really just trying to go where they're not. They've got defenders patrolling the end zone, but they're not as concentrated up here. I'm about 8,000 yards from the river now, I'm real close. This afternoon I'll probably make a break for it.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> It seems weird to me that you'd want to be so close to a town.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> It's usually my game plan whenever I'm in a cross-country game like this one. Especially somewhere like Nebraska. If I'm out in the middle of nowhere, I stick out, right? So someone could spot me from half a mile off. And of course, if I'm in a town, there are lots of eyes and ears on me, and unless it's a real friendly town, word gets around.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> So I like to stay in the periphery. Just outside of town. That's where they forget to look.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> This is so far from my idea of football.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> Football's different things to different people. I see this kind of football, the open-world kind, as its end state. The old grid football, the hundred-yard kind, was basically just training wheels. The game was always all about the field, of course. The ground, the Earth. And it was kind of like, "here. Take this little boring flat grassy rectangle and prove you can really know it and understand it."</p>

And now, to me, football is a further exercise in getting to know and love this world, this planet. You know? The actual ground. It's so rich with history, it's just embarrassing.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> I've been thinking the same thing!</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> You know, I was telling someone just the other day that I can barely walk ten feet without sticking my foot into some kind of sacred ground where something special happened. Maybe a week ago, maybe 10,000 years ago. You see right over there, a couple hundred yards from where I'm standing? That's where Al Capone's brother lived. You know who Al Capone is?</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> Hold on.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> .</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> .</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> His brother lived there. He was a Prohibition agent for the government, can you believe that? All this time his brother was the most famous bootlegger in America, and here he was, doing the exact opposite. At war with each other like they were Greek gods or something. And of course, the town's named after Homer. Can't make that up. It's a funny world.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> So they're not here anymore.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> Oh no, no. They passed long before the Moment, you know, when people stopped passing on.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> .</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> .</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> .</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> I was just thinking about people from back then, the people who lived just a little too soon to live forever. It's not fair.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> It's not. It's really not.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> Do you ever think about those people?</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> I do, I think about them often. I was almost one of them.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> Really?</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> Mhmm.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> I was about the last person in the world you'd expect to see in front of you now. Star running back, I was not. A little after my 70th birthday, I got sick.</p>

I was starting to think, well, pretty soon's probably gonna be my time. I couldn't get out of the house a whole lot. My daughter would come to visit, she was great, but she could only be there some of the time. So a lot of the time I'd just sit in my living room and watch TV.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> I started to watch football. I'd kinda grown up with it a little, but tell you the truth, I hadn't usually been much of a fan. But I got fixed up with a little satellite dish and I'd watch it every Sunday. I watched the Browns a lot.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> Oh, they're good!</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> You were made in 1968?</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> You'd better check your residual memory.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> Okay.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> .</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> .</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> .</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> Oh wow.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> <em>[laughing]</em></p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> I started watchin' 'em because my grandpa was always a big fan. They were bad, they just stunk up the field every week. I think in 2026 they went 3-15, something like that. I loved that about them.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> Because you know, I'd flip around all the channels on the satellite box, and all the shows were about people winning, people succeeding, people getting happy endings. And even in sports, you know, even if a team was having a bad year, it was just kinda their turn to be bad, and in a few years they'd be good again. And I'm sitting on my sofa thinking, a lot of good that does me! I don't know anything about that kind of life! I don't need to see all these stories when I'm sitting in this dusty little house with an oxygen tank. Just don't need it.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> But the Browns, I knew they'd always be there. They'd always lose. I got up every morning, it hurt, and at night I'd go to bed. They'd get up every Sunday, get the tar beat out of them, and they'd show up the next Sunday to do it all again.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> I loved that. I loved them, I felt like</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> I mean, I felt like I was one of them.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> Did they ever win the championship?</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> The Super Bowl?</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> What?</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> .</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> Oh. Yeah.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> Ha. No, no, they never did. The miracle that didn't happen for them, happened for me.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> I remember they gave me three to six months. Well, three months passed, then six. And they drive me to the doctor's, and the doctor's like, "this is not adding up." So they send me to a hospital in the city, run all kinds of tests, and they're like, "well, it's happening to you too!" And I said, "what?" And they said "nothing."</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> Nothing?</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> Nothing. I was getting better. Not even a few years later, I was all the way back to my old self. Those were wild days. For all of us, for everybody, they were wild days.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> And there's no way to know, of course, but I feel like that team carried me that far. That day was the finish line. I think they helped to carry me there.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> I've been thinking about what that's like. Not existing, I mean.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> Well, I guess we'll never know.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> Ten and Juice are really broken up about the bulb.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> I know ... I was so sad to hear about it. Truly tragic. It meant a lot to me, I can only imagine what y'all must be going through.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> They're more sad about it than me ... it's like they're not used to saying goodbye to anything.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> No, none of us are. Best problem to have, I suppose.</p>
      <p class="NINE"><span class="char">NINE: </span> I guess so.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> You know, my grandpa had this big neon sign he always had in the family room. It said "GO BROWNS" on it in big letters and had that brown helmet. I think he brought it home from one of his buddies at the bar or something, couldn't say for sure.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> My grandma thought it looked tacky, I remember she'd always say, "you can turn that thing on after I go to bed." That was the compromise.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> <em>[laughing]</em></p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> The night he passed away, I was staying the night. My grandma woke me up in the middle of the night and said a neighbor was coming by to watch me, that Grandpa had passed on. They'd already taken him away. And in the middle of everybody runnin' around, there were a few minutes there where I was just there by myself in the family room, and that sign was the only thing on. And it just softly lit up the room in this beautiful sort of orange-y brown.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> I was eight years old then, and I remember just kinda standing there and looking at the light, and the room. And you know what I thought?</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> I remember thinking how strange it was that the light was still on. I thought that, well, if he was gone, then the light he switched on should've turned off. That as soon as he went, everything should go with him.</p>
      <p class="NANCY"><span class="char">NANCY: </span> But there it was, though. Just glowing.</p>
