      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> .</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> This ... is! Garbage Football, a podcast in which I, Thuy, and my buddy Roger</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> Hello!</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> dig up the most god-awful football games in the history of civilization, because we ... I don't know why we do this! Because we hate you, listener.</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> We do. We hate you. We actually really hate you this week, because we have an extra-special ... bucket of ... I don't know, bucket of crap of a game for you.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> <em>[laughing]</em> Bucket of crap of a game? What does that mean?</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> You know what I'm trying to say, okay? It's a bad game.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> You know, it's appropriate for us to have a podcast about things that suck, because we're what, 400 episodes in and</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> Who even knows.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> we have no idea how to start a show. Anyways, yes. Game 96249. Rog, this is the one you've been wanting to get around to for a long time.</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> Yes. Normally I'd be worried about overselling one of these, but this one is good. This is better than the Typo Game.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> Dude, no, nothing's better than the Typo Game. For anyone who hasn't heard it, you can go back in our archives and find the episode, I think it's just called "Typo Game." Basically, and I'll make this quick because I don't want to spoil too much, but basically, they were drawing up the rules for a long-distance game, the field dimensions had typos in them, and they ended up with a field that was one yard long and 1,000 yards wide. And they'd already filed the game permit, so they had to play it. Good times.</p>
    <div class="image-container">
    <img class="lazy" data-original="https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MufSWAfSFiDxZoRUrKQYACGseJM=/2880x1400/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8495437/typogame.jpg"></div>  <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> Great times. <em>Amazing</em> times.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> And I'm gonna disagree with you. Today's game is not as dumb as the Typo Game, but it is super dumb.</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> Fair enough.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> So, set the scene for us here.</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> Okay. So this story starts about 13,000 years ago, in March of 4730.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> Super-old game.</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> Suuuuper-old game. Which, you can tell it's so old because the game number is 96249, back when they just gave a registered football game the lowest available number. This was before they went like "fuck it" and just started re-using numbers. Anyways.</p>
    <div class="image-container">
    <img class="lazy" data-original="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zqlc7c6DHcDD0kaaeVPqtLSXko0=/2880x1955/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8495749/fieldabove.jpg"></div>  <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> Washington and New Mexico decided they wanted a long-distance game between their two states, right? And they wanted to get cute. So they sort of made a hybrid of old football rules, and new football rules. The new part, of course, was that the field of play was exactly 2,340,170 yards long.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> Obviously, the field wasn't actually mowed or painted or anything. There was a sensor in the ball that buzzed whenever you went out of bounds. So if you hit the sideline, <em>bzzzt</em>, dead ball.</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> Yes. One goal line was the Washington/Canada border, and the other was the New Mexico/Mexico border. But it's tough to draw the field on a map, because ... the field was standard football width. Fifty-three and one-third yards.</p>
    <div class="image-container">
    <img class="lazy" data-original="https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J8y3QUHWLWiz8yMS2J9fzvf6Z0k=/1280x720/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8495949/utahzoom.gif"></div>  <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> So as a result of these dimensions ... ok, a standard old football field is about twice as wide as it is long, right? Well, if you do the math, and we did do the math, it turns out that this field is <em>43,878 times </em>as long as it is wide.</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> And Thuy, what made this game different from other long-distance game is that ... you know, when you have a field that covers 1,300 miles, it's probably a good idea to have lots and lots of players? Ideally, a few hundred? We can agree on that?</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> We can agree on that!</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> They did not. They kept it to standard football rosters. 11 players on offense, 11 players on defense. Which is completely insane.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> Right! Because, for one it's exhausting, especially if an offense sustains a drive for miles and miles on end. For another ... what happens if you blow coverage and a receiver gets past the secondary? And what if the receiver is the fastest player on the field?</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> Right. If the ball carrier has outrun all 11 of you, what's left to do? At that point, it's not really a football game anymore. It's like a mix between a supermarathon and a camping trip.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> It's bad football. Nobody wants to play it, nobody wants to watch it. Washington and New Mexico were banking on this not being a big deal, because the field of play was so narrow. So the good news is, you know, if a player does get past your secondary, you don't have to look all over creation for them. They're gonna have to stay inbounds, so the only question is how far they've outrun you.</p>

And, you know, we've talked about this a hundred times, but I can't stand "quaint" in game design.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> And obviously, you and I stand pretty far apart on this. I like weird! I like it when the games get weird!</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> And I do too! That's the thing, I do too. I just need it to be in service of something, you know? I see weirdness as a sort of a component, an accent, like a uh, like a seasoning, you know? Not a means to an end. Not a <em>goal</em>.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> You're a purist.</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> I am! I am a purist. Look. I mean, anyone can design a weird football game. But I demand some elegance, some real thought behind it.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> OK, but why?</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> What do you mean, why?</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> I mean, it's not as though you're pressed for time. You've got all the time in the world for what you like and what you don't.</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> Listen. Listen. Even if I have a million years</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> Even if you have a trillion years!</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> Even if I have 100 trillion years! Or more! That doesn't change the fact that I just spent all day watching a shitty game, time I could have spent watching a good one.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> We're forever gonna disagree on this, I think. But! I think an argument could be made that in some respects, Game 96249 <em>did</em> have some elegance to it.</p>

A field 53 yards wide that goes from Mexico to Canada is, on its face, ridiculous. But I will happily admit that its confines are strangely brilliant in a way.</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> È difficile immaginare much more geographic diversity than what this game has. There's plenty of opportunity for some good mountain football in Idaho, plenty of big lakes to navigate, and then when you go south into Utah, there are these big salt flats. There's just nothing there, it's like playing football in a whole bunch of nothing. And then, of course, you've got the deserts in Arizona.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> And scattered throughout, you've got a little bit of farmland and a few small towns. But what I love about this field, at least in theory, is that it forces you to just march forward into all this geography head-on. With most long-distance games, there aren't really any defined sidelines, or at least they're really wide. So if you see a mountain or a lake? You go around it. But not here, You've only got 53 yards of wiggle room. So you just have to grit your teeth and go.</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> And that brings us to your favorite thing!</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> Dio santo.</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> Water ball! There are a few decent-sized chunks of this field that are nothing but water. For example, if you look at uh, there's this one reservoir in Idaho that just kind of swallows two and a half miles of the field.</p>
    <div class="image-container">
    <img class="lazy" data-original="https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vPI0CP-zRFpz62S2kM-LsBzcuaw=/2880x1425/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8496897/waterball.jpg"></div>  <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> So this is how that went down. Washington had the ball at the north coast of the reservoir. They throw it deep into the water, the wall just kinda plops in and floats at the surface. But the ball's still live, right?</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> It didn't touch the ground.</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> Right! What ground? It didn't touch the ground. So what you're left with is a two-mile mad scramble for the ball. It's a live ball the whole time.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> And this is where I'll agree with you. I've watched the replay, this play is exhausting to watch. It's just, like, four hours of splashing around and aimless laterals. It's trash football.</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> And there were a lot of those, too. In the 1900s they were building dams all over the place, so of course you end up with all these giant bodies of water in the middle of nowhere that have no business being there.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> But that aside, I really do love certain pieces of this field. I really do. Up in the mountains, you can tell they kind of tried to position the field so it ran along the ridges, just to make it a little easier. But in other parts it's just like ka-<em>choonk</em>, ka-<em>choonk</em>, ka-<em>choonk,</em> all up and down.</p>

I mean, as a football fan, would I want to watch this? No.</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> Hell no.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> Hell no. I wouldn't want to watch it, but I'd love to read about it. It's like baseball.</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> There was also an element about this you were talking about before the show that I just loved.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> Which one was that?</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> Oh, with the names of all the</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> Yes! Yes yes yes. So, I love the juxtaposition of all this natural beauty, you know, the magnificent horizons, the beautiful mountrain ranges, et cetera, with these ... unbelievably shitty names people gave everything.</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> <em>laughter</em></p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> Like! Like, oh, here's a town next to a bunch of water. Let's call it "Big Water." Oh hey, here's some Meadows. Let's call it "Meadows." Oh look, it's some more meadows over here!</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> Ah shit, Meadows is taken! What do we call it?</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> New Meadows!</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> <em>risate</em></p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> Yeah, Meadows is too crowded! There's like 50 people in it! Time to build a new one!</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> My favorite though, my favorite is, what was it</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> Circleville!</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> YES! Circleville. I guess because it's got a bunch of crop circles?</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> Yeah but like, there are a million places in this country with crop circles. You don't get to be Circleville just because you have like 12 of them! It's like if you just called your city Ground.</p>
    <div class="image-container">
    <img class="lazy" data-original="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hUdolpxxqn0tRfjGnkriHPZJuDU=/2880x1430/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8497035/circleville.jpg"></div>  <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> It's funny, because you know, you look at Los Angeles and it's like "oh, City of Angels! That's a cool name." Or Cincinnati, named after a Roman general or whatever. Chicago comes from a Native American name for a local plant. But these guys in this part of the country were just like, "uhhhhhhh"</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> "Uhhh, there's some circles, we're Circleville now, fuck it, it doesn't matter, I'll probably be eaten by a bear tomorrow."</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> There's just something so darkly funny about this game. I mean, just the pace of it is so frustrating. An offense would spend a week just trying to get over one mountain. Turning over the ball on downs, getting it back, fumbling, getting it back, just crawling up at an excruciating pace. And they're exhausted, and they throw a pick, and <em>boom</em>. Defensive back runs it a mile backwards and it was all for nothing.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> Or shit, 500 miles even. There was</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> Actually, actually, I should note here that you were allowed to use motor vehicles as long as you didn't have the ball. So it wasn't, like, game over once a player ran it back like that. You could catch up with them. You just had to grab a car and go looking for them.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> And that could take a while. At one point, a Washington player managed to sneak downfield from outside Spokane all the way to Utah. And he only got caught because he just ran out of places to hide.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> And, I mean, this is where we really get into how much of a torture chamber this game is. The drive chart is just ... it's an absolute goddamn nightmare. If you turned off the game and turned it back on in a year, the line of scrimmage might be, like, 50 miles away from where it was.</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> And that's really nothing! That's no movement. 50 miles is nothing when you consider, first of all, the field's like 20 times longer than that, and second, it might move 50 miles the opposite way the next year.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> And that, Roger, sets the stage for the ... maybe one of the most frustrating things I've ever seen as a football fan.</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> Same. Oh Lord, same. You wanna ...</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> All right, so it's now the year 5518. The game is now 788 years old.</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> They've been playing all this time.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> All this time. For almost 800 years, the ball's been going up and down and up and down ... and usually, very, very slowly. It's so hard for either offense to build the sort of momentum that would allow you to drive, you know, even a hundred miles down the field.</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> But Washington is finally doing it!</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> Yes! They've finally made it into Arizona. It's just, something clicks. They're in the desert, ripping off huge plays. Half a mile run. Quarter-mile pass. Just boom, boom, boom, one after another. And then ... they just fell off a cliff.</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> That's really fun to say. Because you know, we're always figuratively saying, "oh, they fell off a cliff." Like, their offense stalled out or something. No, they fell off a cliff for real.</p>
    <div class="image-container">
    <img class="lazy" data-original="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UzWVTGDYvvP_v4NL1S6iOS2zKd0=/1280x720/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8497211/horseshoe.gif"></div>  <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> Washington literally fell off a cliff and into a gorge. So they've got another cliff staring them in the face. They turn the ball over on downs, but of course, now New Mexico turns around and sees the other cliffside staring at 'em! The game's stuck.</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> Right. They can't just run around the side of the cliff, because that would be out of bounds. They can't climb up, because it's a 300-yard vertical free climb, which is something you can only complete if you're one of the best free climbers on Earth. And it's impossible if you've got 11 people right behind you who can just grab you by the ankles and yank you back down.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> So on this field that's more than two million yards long, these two teams are stuck in this little speck of 250 yards.</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> So.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> So.</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> How did this happen, Thuy?</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> There's really no satisfying explanation. This game was on the drawing board for years and years. They surveyed every bit of it, and they'd always intended for the field to pass through just slightly west.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> This was kind of the crown jewel of this game. The rock faces were more forgiving there, because there was this valley that sort of fed into it. It still would have been the most challenging part of the field, but it absolutely would have been doable.</p>
    <div class="image-container">

      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> Hmm ...</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> Yeah, "hmm." Because look, we know how meticulously they planned this game. We know how important that spot was. An entire committee spent years planning this? How could they possibly have messed that up by accident?</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> Well, if somebody knows, they're not telling.</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> Maybe one day we'll find the answer. In the meantime, this game is still in progress. It's one of the oldest and longest-running games in Arizona, and in year number 12,258, it's still going strong. And if you ever have the unexplainable urge to watch 22 players duke it out to no apparent end in the bottom of a canyon, you can always see it for yourself, football channel number 96249.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> I would rather do anything else in the world. But! We have a mystery on our hands. Why is the field lined up wrong? Simple mistake, or sabotage, or what? If anyone out there has any info that'll help us crack this case, shoot us an email. We'd love to talk to you.</p>
      <p class="ROGER"><span class="char">ROGER: </span> Help us solve the greatest, dumbest mystery of our time.</p>
      <p class="THUY"><span class="char">THUY: </span> So that does it for this episode of Garbage Football. We'll be back Tuesday, and don't forget, premium subscribers will get a bonus episode on Friday. I'm Thuy.</p>
